# Change left-side headings
spaces of left-side longest heading (with css classes heading1 or heading2) should made with 	non-breaking space(&nbsp;).

longest heading also should have  
margin-left:30px;
margin-right:30px;
in current sample designe heading2 is the longest.

As right-side width:45%; becarefull when you have thin left-side content.Because right side content can be too small.if that the case increase 45% to higher.but it will not affect the right side as outer(parent) and left-side divs do not have "width" property defined.
